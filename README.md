## Overview

## My process

Bash my head against the keyboard.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned how to add the top visual part of each cell. This was also a good exercise to improve my flexbox and grid skills. 

### Continued development

I would make the spacing more accurate if I were to continue working. I would also experiment with an "ipad" view because the site looks strange on medium screens before the breakpoint.

### Useful resources

Tailwind Docs.
